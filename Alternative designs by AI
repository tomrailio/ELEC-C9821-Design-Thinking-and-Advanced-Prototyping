The final case and the surface connector needs to be compared to other alternatives as well. Instead of just 3D printing several
different cases, we propose also designs made by AI which in this context means prompt engineering with the help of ChatGPT and
MidJourney applications. The general trustworthyness of these technologies is of very high quality and most of the remaining
weaknesses can be reduced by a usability survey based on Nielsen heuristics. The alternative designs by this AI methodology will 
include also manually tunable parameters, in order to have designs reflecting the desired 'look and feel'.
